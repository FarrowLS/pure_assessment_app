The Pure Assessment App is a mobile friendly low stakes assessment web application. The use case for this app is testing situations where the user needs to complete the assessment but sending them to a testing center is overkill. An example of this would be a test for a concussion awarness program for youth sports. Since items (questions) are randomly selected from an item bank and their choices (answers) order are randomized, there is no practical way for users to pass around "answer keys". This means user need to activily complete the assessment which is intended to be part of the learning process.

This web app is build with the Python based Django framework on the back-end and uses the Twitter Bootstrap HTML5 framework for layout on the front-end. In its current form it should be consitered a high fidelity prototype. Bootstrap, first used to create responsive wireframes, has been added in a grey scale color scheme similar to the grey scale colors seen in Balsamiq and is meant to only convey functionality and not aesthetics. On the more technical side, the app has not been scaled but could be for example using RabbitMQ for queueing and Memcached for caching.
